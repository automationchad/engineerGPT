From day one, we’ve tried to make the most of emerging technology and do things a little bit differently. Back in the mid-90s it was the concept of online. These days it’s the market-leading latest in health and safety Business Intelligence (BI) tools.

ANSWER:
It is important to Evotix that we effect our customers and the local community positively as we conduct our work, both on a corporate and an individual level. 
 
Supporting health and wellbeing
Health, safety and wellbeing are of the utmost importance to Evotix, and we support our employees (including those involved as part of [Client Name]'s implementation team), in several ways.
- Mental Health days are provided, in addition to bank holidays, to allow staff to disconnect from work and take time out for themselves

Environmental initiatives
As a SaaS provider, Evotix as a organisation have a very low impact on the environment. We do not measure our carbon impact or have a target to reduce it. We do have an Environmental Policy which outlines our commitment to reducing our environmental impact and continually improving our environmental performance, along with a number of initiatives to reduce our impact:  
 
- Cycle to Work Scheme: We have a cycle to work scheme in place, minimising the number of employees driving to work or using public transport.
- Low CO2 Output: In order to limit the amount of commuting/travelling, we encourage the use of conference software such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom, both to conduct meetings internally and with customers.
- Work from Home Scheme: We operate a work from home scheme, whereby many of our staff do not need to come into one of our offices to work if it isn’t necessary. Not only does this provide our staff with more flexibility and work/life balance, it is also reduces our company CO2 output as staff aren’t commuting to work using public transport or driving to work.
- IT Systems: All of our IT systems are SaaS, this means no hosting of servers directly by Evotix with the servers our systems run on, also hosting other customers of our suppliers. This leads to lowered environmental impact from energy use
 
Contributing to our community
Evotix has a dedicated Charity Committee which organises several efforts each year to raise money for local/national charities such as MIND, National Emergency Trust, Red Cross and most recently The Outward Bound Trust. Our latest fundraiser included a group of colleagues cycling from Manchester to London.
 
Developing our people
We have a full equality, diversity and equal opportunities policy as well as issuing a Modern Slavery Statement, demonstrating our commitment to ensuring fair working practices for our employees and contractors. 
 
We support the development of our people through a number of channels including:
- Town Hall meetings held every two weeks allowing communication to staff, but also the ability to ask anonymous questions or send anonymous feedback
- Managers and their staff have regular one to ones 
- At least once per year, a best self review is held allowing staff to receive feedback from their manager, reports and peers on their positive traits and to provide constructive feedback on areas which may help them
Evotix is also proud to have graduate and apprenticeship schemes in place. We have hired over 40 new graduates and apprentices in the past 4 years, many of whom have subsequently been promoted within the organisation. We support all employees with continuous professional development which includes training opportunities to ensure they are able to progress in their role and with the company.

QUESTIONS:
Provide an overview of the products you offer.
ANSWER:
We harness the latest technologies to give people intuitive, human tools that address their most pressing EHS and well-being challenges. We continuously embrace new ideas and develop dynamic technology-driven solutions that are built for a rapidly changing world.
 
Our solution, Assure, is an enterprise strength health and safety platform that has been built based on over 25 years’ experience within the health and safety solutions market. While we are not health and safety consultants, we do understand the issues that health and safety professionals face and Assure reflects this within its design and functionality.
 
Assure is a modular solution which allows customers to pick and choose the functionality they need today and add-on additional functionality as and when requirements change. Evotix has been serving several customers for over 10 years and those customer journeys have given us a keen insight into how a well-implemented health and safety regimen can reinforce wider organisational development and build a robust, companywide health and safety culture.
 
Because of its vast configurability, Assure supports the dynamism and adaptability that a truly global operation requires from its talent, its resources and its governance arrangements. This means that [Client Name] Administrators can configure or change the solution - as and when required - without the need to revert to a Supplier and incurring costly charges. Commonly, any system constantly changed through customisation (changes to base-line code) becomes unwieldy and, therefore, dramatically effects the user experience and overall management. This is what Evotix avoids.
 
As an Evotix customer you will enjoy a true SaaS solution that is highly configurable, scalable, future proof and provides an intuitive user experience; all with a total cost of ownership many times lower than an equivalent self-hosted solution and with ingrained continuous improvement that keeps you current with best practice in a way beyond the scope of a bespoke solution. We release updates (fixes, new functionality etc.) to the platform every 2 weeks, again completely free of charge to our current customers.
 
For the Health and Safety professional, partnering with Evotix means working with a provider you can be sure is constantly working to accommodate new developments, promote client success and share insights that will help you stay current with and be ready to champion change and improvement to all parts and at all levels of the business.
 
In 2021 we acquired StoryShare, and its e-Learning and engagement training tool has become Evotix Learn. With the integration of these we are able to provide customers with micro learning content on the go, to support customers in their health and safety management and ensure front line workers are competent and skilled to undertake their duties.
